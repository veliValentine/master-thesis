Node.js is a asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime environment that is designed to build scalable network applications (\cite{node.jsAbout}).
In its core process it uses event loop at runtime to handle callbacks.
Node.js is able to perform blocking I/O event within a single runtime thread by offloading operations to system kernel when possible (\cite{node.jsEventLoop}).
These operations are called non-blocking operations or asynchronous operations (\cite{node.jsOverviewBlockVsNonBlock}).
Events that block the event loop from continuing its process are called blocking operations or synchronous operations.
Node.js itself is able to perform one event at any given time and offloading processes when required to continue working on other events.
