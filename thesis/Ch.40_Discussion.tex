\section{Notes}
\textit{What does the results tell?}
Independent service is faster.
For component with critical performance it should be excluded for any other process.

\textit{What can affects the results?}
Bad code from other components can block the event loop affecting the performance of other components in monolith environment.

\textit{Difference in other programming languages.}
JavaScript is bad programming language for performance critical system.

\textit{Discussion on the benchmarks on JavaScript and other programming languages.}

\textit{Benefits of the results.}
For the studied case it is beneficial to refactor components to independent services.

\textit{Any biased towards the research.}
Expected that the performance is better in single service than in monolith.

\textit{Any problems that might have affected the results.}
No control over used resources. No equal resources with monolith and microservice. Now the performance is affected by the used cpu.

\textit{Different view points considered.}

\textit{Ethical issues.}

\textit{Practical implications.}

\textit{Comparison to related work}


\section{Related work}
There are many studies related to the performance of node.js application.
Studies compared node.js server performance to other programming languages.
\cite{Challapalli}, \cite{Lion} and many others compared performance of node.js server to servers build with different programming languages including python, .net, java, c++, php etc.
These studies mainly focused on the throughput and response time of a servers through its application programming interfaces with different user scenarios.

\section{Future Studies}
\subsection{Notes}
Controlled Experiment to see if the results can be reproduced.

Case study to measure other components performances in the studied system and see if there is a correlation with the results.

See if the results are specific to javascirpt or if they can be reproduced with single threaded language like rust or multithreaded language like java or C\#
