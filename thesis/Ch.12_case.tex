\chapter{The Case\label{case}}
The research studies a server side software component.
It is written using JavaScript with Node.js.
The component performance is measured in two different environments.
One where the component is part of a monolith application.
In the second environment the components is running as an independent service.
The component is the same in both environments.

\section{Overview of the component}
The component is written in JavaScript using Node.js.
It's response time is critical to the system.
The component can not be scaled horizontally.

The component contains four modules.
Module A, B, C and D.
Each module performs in sequence.
The modules and their functionality are independent from their environment.

The \textbf{module A} is the first module in the sequence.
It starts the cycle and is always performed.
It makes four external calls.

The \textbf{module B} is the second module in the sequence.
It runs after \textbf{module A}.
The \textbf{module B} makes one external call.

The \textbf{module C} is the third module in the sequence.
It is run after \textbf{module B} and when response from \textbf{module B} triggers it.
It makes four external calls.

The \textbf{module D} is the final module in the sequence.
It is run after the module C runs.
It makes one external call.

When any of the modules fails to perform its task an error is raised and the cycle is interrupted.
When modules are running without errors the modules A and B are always performed. 
The modules C and D are run only when the data from \textbf{module B} triggers them.
Each module waits for the response of every external call before continuing their process.

\section{Monolith overview}
The monolith uses Node.js version 14.19.1. The node version runs using V8 engine version \textit{8.4.371.23-node.85}.

The monolith application is a three tier application containing user interface, server side and database.
The server side contains four components.
One of the components is the component studied in this research.

\section{The independent service}
The independent service uses Node.js version 14.18.3. The node version runs using the v8 engine version \textit{8.4.371.23-node.85}.

The service contains only the component studied in this research and some functionality that allows communication with the component.
