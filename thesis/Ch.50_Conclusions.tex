\chapter{Conclusions\label{conclusions}}
This research studies performance of a server side JavaScript software component.
Performance is defined as the time the component takes to processing its blocking events.
All non blocking calls from the component are timed and excluded from the performance review in order to capture the response time of all blocking events in the component.
The component performance is measured when it is a part of a monolith application and when it is refactored into its own service.
The component is not modified between environments.
The components performance is critical tot he system.
