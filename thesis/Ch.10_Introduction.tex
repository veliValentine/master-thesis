\chapter{Introduction\label{intro}}
In this paper we study a case where a node.js component inside a monolith application is refactored to be a part of microservice architecture.
We are going to study the difference in the components blocking events performance in these environments and how the single threaded event loop of node.js affects it.
Results provides performance insight for refactoring similar components from the monolith into microservice architecture.
Provided results are crucial to the system since the components performance are critical to the system.

A deeper review of node.js and its event loop is given in the background chapter.
In the case chapter an overview of the case architecture is given including a review of the studied component.
Methods for collecting components performance data and related literature are described in the methods chapters and their results in the following results chapter.
Discussion of found results and their meaning is found in the related discussion chapter.
