Analysis from the data...

\section{Significance Tests}
Let $\mu_m$ be the mean response time of the component in the monolith and $\mu_i$ be the mean response time of the component in independent service.
To see if the data is sufficient enough to prove that $\mu_i > \mu_m$ a one sided Z test is performed with null hypothesis \textbf{H0}: $\mu_m \leq \mu_i$ against the alternative hypothesis \textbf{H1}: $\mu_m > \mu_i$.

When $\overline{x}_m$ is the sample mean, $S_m^2$ the sample variance and $n_m$ the sample size in the monolith 
and $\overline{x}_i$ the sample mean, $S_i^2$ sample variance and $n_i$ the sample size in the independent service.
The value of test statistic $TS$ is
\[
TS=\frac{\overline{x}_m-\overline{x}_i}{\sqrt{\frac{S_m^2}{n_m}+\frac{S_i^2}{n_i}}}
\]
\[
TS=32.857757... \approx 32.858
 \].
 
With one sided Z test the null hypothesis \textbf{H0} will be rejected when the $p$ value 
equals the probability that a standard normal is as large as $TS$. Calculating the $p$ value we get
\[
\text{p value} = P\{Z\geq TS\} \approx P\{Z\geq 32.858\} \leq P\{Z\geq 3.49\} = 0.0002
\].
Since the $p$ value is at least $0.0002$ the null hypothesis \textbf{H0} can be rejected with any significance level above $0.02\%$. % It doesn't  make any sense

Since the null hypothesis \textbf{H0} was rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis \textbf{H1} we can say that the mean response time in the monolith is statistically slower than the mean response time in the single service.
